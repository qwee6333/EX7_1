'Dear John,' the letter began. 'I have found someone else whom I think the world of. I think the only way out is for us to get a divorce,' it said. They usually began like that, those letters that told of infidelity on the part of the wives of servicemen... The men called them 'Dear Johns'.

親愛的約翰：我已經找到在這世界上最適合我的人，我想我們之間唯一能作的事情就是離婚...
